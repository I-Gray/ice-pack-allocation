# Ice Pack Allocator ðŸ§Š
Allocates a specified number of ice-packs to a customers box calculated by considering:
- A range of defined temperature bands for different sized cool pouches
- The predicted temperature for the postcode on the planned delivery date of the box
- A set of configurable fall back constants for ranges not explicitly specificed in the range data


## Set-up
1. Clone the repository
2. In the `src` directory, create a file named `config.json` and copy `config.example.json` to the file.
3. Add a valid `meteostat_api_key` in the value section of the secret.
4. In the root director, run the following make command to perform project set-up and run the script:
```commandline
make run-script
```
4. If the run is successful, the output 

## Running Tests
To run the all the unit tests, run the following make command in the root directory:
```commandline
make run-tests
```
Note: ensure the `local-setup` and/or `run-script` have been run first to ensure the requirements are installed.

## Dependencies
This project depends on two external services & the two input files as explained in the next section:
1. [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/docs) - to get the approximate latitude and longitude for a selected **UK** postcode
2. [Meteo Stat API](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/) - to obtain average daily weather data for a given lattitude and longitude

## Input
The Ice Pack Allocator requires the following 2 input files - included in the repo:

```bash
/src/data/Boxes.csv
and 
/src/data/Temperature_bands.csv
```

Below is an outline of the csv columns
```text
Boxes.csv - 
    box_id: str
    delivery_date: datetime
    postcode: str
    Box Size: str
    Cool Pouch Size: str


Temperature_bands.csv - 
    temperature_min: int
    temperature_max: int
    S: int
    M: int
    L: int
```
S, M & L in the `Temperature Bands` refers to the amount of ices that should be assigned for the Small, 
Medium and Large box sizes for that particular range.

## Output
Once the allocator has run, the output is placed here:

```commandline
src/output/orders_assigned_w_ice.csv
```

The schema of this output is: 

```text
orders_assigned_with_ice.csv - 
    box_id: str
    cool_pouch_size: str
    number_of_ices: int
```
